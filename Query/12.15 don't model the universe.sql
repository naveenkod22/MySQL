-- 12.15 don't model the universe

-- don't try to generalize the model to fit future requirements, it results in complex model and some times may be wasted
-- dot't forget scope, context, requirements 

-- solve today problems, not futer problems that may never happen
-- build a model for problem domain, not for real world
